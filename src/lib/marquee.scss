  * On Firefox & Safari, there was an issue where the Marquee does not play
  * unless the window is resized or the play state is toggled.
  *
  * This was happening because the animation was loaded before the marqueeWidth
  * had finished calculations, so the animation was animating
  * with a marqueeWidth of 0. Adding an animation-delay of 0.01s
  * fixed the issue in Firefox, but the issue still persisted in Safari.
  *
  * The .ready class aims to solve this issue for all cases by waiting
  * until marqueeWidth is larger than the default of 0 before
  * loading up the animation.
